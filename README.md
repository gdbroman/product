# Notes on product development

* Every screen should have a **main CTA**
  * Ask: *Where do I want my user's eyes to go?*'
* Every product should have a **magical moment**
  * New users should feel *"Wow! Now I get it'* ASAP after signup/purchase
  * Example: for AirBnb it's being greeted with a welcome card & cookies waiting on the kitchen table
  * Ask: *What is my app's magical moment and how do I make it near-instant?*
* Don't apply DRY to UX (it isn't code) 
  * Software engineering is a search for the simplest primitives and abstractions
  * Product development is about user empathy and communication
  * Just like in a speech you sometimes need to repeat yourself twice or even thrice for the message to sink in
  * Do ruthlessly deprioritize features that don't add value
  * But don't be afraid to add complexity or "UX redundancy" (e.g. a signup btn in 2 places) if it increases conversion or helps your user understand the product
* Don't over-systematize design
  * If you're an engineer you'll want to systematize the design system
  * This is great in some cases, e.g. using consistent padding jumps and font sizes
  * You'll likely need ~20 colors in your palette, many of which will have to be hand-picked as opposed to mathematically derived
* Consumer apps are arrived at through a shit-ton of experiments
  * Develop a conclusive testing habit so you can navigate with conviction
