# Notes on product development

*A living document where I'm writing down lessons on product development, user experience, and user interface design. Mostly relevant for consumer apps.*

1. **Big features can have a small footprint**
    * When having the idea for a new feature, do not give way to excitement
    * The first iteration is never correct – and often too brazen
    * Think of the FaceBook like button – just a button, but super pivotal
2. **Problem first, solution second, aesthetics third**
    * The problem you're solving matters more than how you solve it, and how you solve it matters more than what your solution looks like
    * SaaS are like screwdrivers while social apps are like clothing—function matters, but users care about look and feel too
3. **Main CTA**
    * For each screen, ask: *Where do I want my user's eyes to go?*'
4. **Mobile CTAs should be bigger**
    * The thumb is less precise than the mouse, so buttons should oftentimes be made *bigger* on mobile screens, not smaller
5. **Mobile first**
    * ~70% of internet traffic is mobile, so this will probably be the traffic breakdown for your app as well
    * Develop your app inside of a mobile browser view or iPhone simulator
6. **Magical moment**
    * New users should "get it" as soon as possible after signup/purchase
    * For example, being greeted with cookies on the kitchen table in your freshly cleaned AirBnb
    * Ask: *What is my app's magical moment and how do I make it near-instant?*
7. **Avoid applying DRY to UX**
    * Software engineering is a search for simple primitives and abstractions, product development is more about user empathy and communication
    * For example, don't be afraid to add a signup button at both the top and the bottom of the same screen if it increases conversion or helps your users understand your product
    * Just like in speech, you sometimes need to repeat yourself twice or thrice for the message to sink in
8. **Avoid over-systematizing design**
    * If you're an engineer you'll be tempted to systematize the design system
    * This is great in some cases, e.g. using utility classes for consistent padding and font size jumps
    * But you'll likely need more than 3 colors, many of which will have to be hand-picked as opposed to mathematically derived
9. **Consumer apps are arrived at through a shit-ton of experiments**
    * Make it fun and easy to experiment
    * Run conclusive tests
    * Navigate with conviction
