## Notes

* Every screen should have a main CTA
* Don't be too mathematical when creating UIs
  * If you're an engineer you'll want to systematize UI
  * Using consistent padding jumps can be great
  * But sometimes you want redundancy in terms of user options
  * And many times you'll need 20 shades of a color
  * Design can be systematized to an extent
  * But it is an art at the end of the day
