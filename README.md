# Notes on product development

* **Every screen should have a main CTA**
  * Ask: *Where do I want my user's eyes to go?*'
* **Every product should have a magical moment**
  * New users should feel *"Wow! Now I get it'* ASAP after signup/purchase
  * For example, being greeted with cookies on the kitchen table in your freshly cleaned Airbnb
  * Ask: *What is my app's magical moment and how do I make it near-instant?*
* **Big features can have a small footprint**
  * When having the idea for a new feature, do not give way to excitement
  * The first iteration is never correct, and often too brazen
  * Think the FB like button – just a button, super valuable
* **Don't apply DRY to UX – it isn't code**
  * Software engineering is a search for the simplest primitives and abstractions, product development is about user empathy and communication
  * Just like in speech, you sometimes need to repeat yourself twice or thrice for the message to sink in
  * Do ruthlessly deprioritize features that don't add value, but don't be afraid to add complexity or "UX redundancy" (e.g. a signup btn in 2 spots) if it increases conversion or helps your user understand the product
* **Don't over-systematize design**
  * If you're an engineer you'll want to systematize the design system
  * This is great in some cases, e.g. utility classes for consistent padding jumps and font sizes
  * But you'll likely more than 3 colors, many of which will have to be hand-picked as opposed to mathematically derived
* **Consumer apps are arrived at through a shit-ton of experiments**
  * Make it easy to experiment
  * Run conclusive experiments
  * Navigate with conviction
