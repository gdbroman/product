# Product Thinking

Notes on building great product, intended for software engineers.

## Notes

* Every screen should have a main CTA
  * Ask: where do I want my user to look?
* Every product should have a magical moment
  * It's when your user goes *"Wow! Now I get it"* – ideally it's ASAP after signup/purchase
  * For AirBnb it's entering the apartment with a greeting card and cookies waiting on the kitchen table
  * Ask: What is my app's magical moment? How do I shorten the its timeline for first-time users?
* Don't over-simplify
  * Software engineering is a search for the simplest primitives and abstractions
  * Product development is about user empathy and communication
  * Just like in a speech, sometimes you need to repeat yourself twice or thrice for the message to sink in
  * Do ruthlessly deprioritize features that don't add value
  * But don't be afraid to add complexity or "UX redundancy" if it helps the user understand your product
* Don't over-systematize
  * If you're an engineer you'll want to systematize the design system
  * This is great in some cases, e.g. using consistent padding jumps and font sizes
  * But 3 colors is not enough, you'll likely need ~20 in your palette – and many will have to be hand-picked as opposed to mathematically derived
