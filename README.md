# Product Thinking for Engineers

Notes on building great product, intended for software engineers.

## Notes

* Every screen should have a main CTA
  * Ask: where do I want my user to look?
* Every product should have a magical moment
  * It's that moment where your user goes "Wow! Now I get it", ideally the user gets to experience it ASAP
  * For AirBnb it's entering the apartment with a greeting card and cookies waiting on the kitchen table
  * Ask: What is the magical moment for my app? How do I make my user experience it as fast as possible? 
* Don't over-simplify
  * Software engineering is a search for the simplest primitives and abstractions
  * Product development is about empathy and communicating to the end-user
  * Just like in a speech, sometimes you need to repeat yourself twice or even thrice
* Don't over-systematize
  * If you're an engineer you'll want to systematize the design system
  * This is great in some cases, e.g. using consistent padding jumps and font sizes
  * But 3 colors is not enough, you'll more likely need 20 in your palette, and many you will have to hand pick despite them "not making mathematical sense"
