# product-mastery

## Notes

* Every screen should have a main CTA
* Don't over-mathematize UI/UX
  * Using consistent padding jumps and a consistent color palette can be great
  * Software engineering is a search for the simplest primitives and abstractions
  * The same is *almost* true for product development
  * If you're an engineer you'll want to systematize UI (consistent padding jumps,)
  * But sometimes you want redundancy in terms of user options
  * And many times you'll need 20 shades of a color
  * Design can be systematized to an extent
  * But it is an art at the end of the day
