# Notes on product development

* Every screen should have a **main CTA**
  * Ask: *Where do I want my user's eyes to go?*'
* Every product should have a **magical moment**
  * ASAP after signup or purchase a new user should have a moment of *"Wow! Now I get it'*
  * For AirBnb, it's entering a clean apartment with a greeting card and cookies waiting on the kitchen table
  * Ask: *What is my app's magical moment and how do I make it near-instant?*
* Don't over-simplify
  * Software engineering is a search for the simplest primitives and abstractions
  * Product development is about user empathy and communication
  * Just like in a speech, sometimes you need to repeat yourself twice or thrice for the message to sink in
  * Do ruthlessly deprioritize features that don't add value
  * But don't be afraid to add complexity or "UX redundancy" if it helps the user understand your product
* Don't over-systematize
  * If you're an engineer you'll want to systematize the design system
  * This is great in some cases, e.g. using consistent padding jumps and font sizes
  * But 3 colors is not enough, you'll likely need ~20 in your palette â€“ and many will have to be hand-picked as opposed to mathematically derived
* Consumer apps are arrived at through a shit ton of experiments
  * Develop a conclusive testing habit so you can navigate with conviction
