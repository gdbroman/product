# Notes on product development

1. **Every screen should have a main CTA**
    * Ask: *Where do I want my user's eyes to go?*'
3. **Every product should have a magical moment**
    * New users should feel *"Wow! Now I get it'* ASAP after signup/purchase
    * For example, being greeted with cookies on the kitchen table in your freshly cleaned Airbnb
    * Ask: *What is my app's magical moment and how do I make it near-instant?*
3. **Big features can have a small footprint**
    * When having the idea for a new feature, do not give way to excitement
    * The first iteration is never correct – and often too brazen
    * Think the FB like button – just a button, but super valuable
4. **Don't apply DRY to UX – it isn't code**
    * Software engineering is a search for the simplest primitives and abstractions, product development is about user empathy and communication
    * Just like in speech, you sometimes need to repeat yourself twice or thrice for the message to sink in
    * Do ruthlessly deprioritize features that don't add value, but don't be afraid to add complexity or "UX redundancy" (e.g. a signup btn at the top and the bottom of the same screen), if it increases conversion or helps your user understand your product
5. **Don't over-systematize design**
    * If you're an engineer you'll be tempted to systematize the design system
    * This is great in some cases, e.g. using utility classes for consistent padding and font size jumps
    * But you'll likely need more than 3 colors, many of which will have to be hand-picked as opposed to mathematically derived
6. Problem first, solution second, aesthetics third
    * The problem you're solving matters more than how you solve it, and how you solve it matters more than how the solution looks
    * But aesthetics still matter, especially in social apps
    * SaaS is like the screwdriver market—mostly about function. Social apps are more like clothing—users care a lot more about look and feel
7. **Consumer apps are arrived at through a shit-ton of experiments**
    * Make it fun and easy to experiment
    * Run conclusive experiments
    * Navigate with conviction
